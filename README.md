# AndroidRawZxing
Feeding ZXing QR code reader from low-level Android Camera2 API

Contains a snapshot of the ZXing core in `app/src/main/java/com/google/zxing`
and a simplified _Camera2_ controller feeding into the core in `app/src/main/java/com/ieb/zxingtest`.

This uses nothing beyond the most basic Android APIs, and should work with any app using API 26 or up.
